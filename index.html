        <h2>About</h2>

        <p class="center-class">
            After you draw/map an object in JOSM you need to add information to this object to describe what it is. You can
            add attributes to a point, line or shape by attaching tags to it. We are going to use in this tutorial the JOSM Presets
            menu so we can easily attach the correct tags to an object. The JOSM <em class="guilabel">Presets</em> menu gives you a way to find the object you want
            to create and fill the information (tags) in a form.
        </p>

        <h3>Introduction to Tags and Presets</h3>

        <p class="center-class">
            We have an object drawn in JOSM and now we need to add tags to describe what it is, its name, and many other attributes.
            For example we have created a supermarket store with the name "My Supermarket Store", we need two tags for it:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    to describe the point as a grocery store
                </li>
                <li>
                    to hold the name of the grocery store
                </li>
            </ul>
            You can see the tags of an object in JOSM in the <em class="guilabel">Properties</em> panel.
            <img class="home" src="img/prop_panel.png" alt="Properties Panel." title="JOSM Properties panel.">

            <br>

            Tags consists of two parts:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <em class="guilabel">key</em> = typically defines the type of information you are attaching
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em class="guilabel">value</em> = defines the specific object
                </li>
            </ul>

            <b>e.g.</b> for our supermarket example we have two tags, so two pairs of key and value
            <ul>
                <li><b>KEY = VALUE</b></li>
                <li><b>name = Penny Market XXL</b></li>
                <li><b>shop = supermarket</b></li>
            </ul>
            After we create a point with this tags, JOSM editor will display it like this:
            <br>
            <img class="home" src="img/josm_supermarket.png" alt="JOSM supermarket display." title="JOSM supermarket display.">
            <br>
            And, on the OpenStreetMap website the object looks like this:
            <br>
            <img class="home" src="img/osm_supermarket.png" alt="OSM web-browser supermarket display." title="OSM web-browser supermarket display.">
            <br>
            This works and it is displayed correctly because we have applied the correct tags. But, different mappers from different
            parts of the world might disagree on how to tag common this. For example, it is important that all schools have the same
            tag description. If some people tag schools as <b>amenity=school</b> and other people tag it as <b>education=school</b>, there
            is a problem. So, to make everything consistent and give everyone an agreed standard on how to tag places there is a standard on
            how to tag places and can be found on the <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features"><em class="guilabel">Map Features</em></a> page on the OSM wiki

            As you can see there are quite a lot of tags and their respective objects on the wiki page. It is unrealistically to think
            that we can remember those all the time and going to the wiki page to check how is tagged a specific object might not be always
            convenient. So, JOSM editor has a Presets menu that makes applying the correct tag much easier. With this menu we can find the option for
            school, introduce the information in the form and be sure that we have tagged the building correctly. When we add tags using the presets menu
            the correct tags are added to the object in the Presets Panel.

        </p>

        <h3>JOSM Preset options</h3>
        <p>
            JOSM comes preloaded with a presets menu that includes the most common types of geographic options. But sometimes those are not enough,
            and you want to add additional presets. To do that, there are two options:
            <ul>
        <li>
            create your own presets menu (write it in XML and then load it in JOSM)
        </li>
        <li>
            load additional presets file for specific information that you might want to collect (in this situation you only need to load existing presets files, so no XML knowledge is required)
        </li>
            </ul>


            We are going to further discuss how to load additional presets files into JOSM.
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Open the <em class="guilabel">Preference</em> menu from JOSM, <em class="guilabel">Edit -> Preferences </em>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Click on the <em class="guilabel">Map Settings</em> button, is the third button from top and looks like this:
                    <br>
                    <img class="home" src="img/menu_button.png" alt="Map Settings button." title="Map Settings button.">
                    <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Click on the third label named <em class="guilabel">Tagging Presets</em> (if it is the first time you do this it might take awhile
                    to load all the existing presets option from OpenStreetMap)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Select <em class="guilabel">Animal facilities by Viking81</em> and click the right arrow to add it to the active presets.
                    <br>
                    <img class="home" src="img/active_presets.png" alt="Active presets selected." title="Active presets selected.">
                    <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Click OK and restart JOSM.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Create a new layer by going to <em class="guilabel">File -> New Layer</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Create a point and select it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Go to <em class="guilabel">Presets</em> menu and you should see the presets option that you have just added.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Click on it and you should see the form that will let you fill up the tags.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
